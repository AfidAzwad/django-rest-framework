Project Name: DRF5_FunctionBasedAPIview
App Name: APIview

This project is based on Django REST Framework. Here I have introduced to Function Based API view. Using this we have shorten our lines of codes.
Though we have used thirdparty app for API testing which is not a good practice but in this project we will get the browsable REST Api from this 
url : http://127.0.0.1:8000/stapiview/
By this built-in browsable REST Framework we can test our API.

Thank You
