Project Name: DRF_CRUD_ClassBasedView
App Name: CRUD_ClassBased

This project is based on Django REST Framework. Here I have shown the 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT'/'PATCH' and 'DELETE' requests of CRUD operations.
We have shown the CRUD operatons through a third-party app. The main part is Class Based View in views.py.

Thank You
