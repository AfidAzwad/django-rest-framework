Project Name: DRF4_ModelSerializer
App Name: modelSerializer

This project is based on Django REST Framework. Here I have worked with the 'POST' request of CRUD operations to show the working procedure of Model Serializer through a third-party app.
Advantages of Model Serializer than a regular serializer :

1. It extract fields of a table from models.py
2. No need to write any fields name separately if nothing is assigning to that field.
3. No need to create functions of POST, GET, UPDATE and DELETE in the Serializer class.

Thank You
